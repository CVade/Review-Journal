# Review-Journal Template

### In the words of Ed Latimore:

## Purpose
```
Create a general template for a Journal website that can be later customized to suit the website's chosen topic/purpose.
```

## Project Goals
 - Upon loading into the website's Homepage, a description of the Journal's purpose will be on display which initially will be generic but customizable. There will be a Navbar located in the heading with a "Home" button/icon, a "New Article" button, and at least three other clickable tabs each assigned to a individual "Category". 
 - These tabs will be classified and titled by Category and linked to their own respective webpages, where based on a Journal article's selected Category is where said articles will be posted and located for later reading. I also intend to add a "Search" feature into the Navbar for quicker navigation of ALL articles within local storage.
 - Upon clicking the "New Article" button, a new webpage will appear in which the user will see several input boxes labeled as "Title", "Date", "Category", "Brief Description", and "Review", where they will be prompted to enter information into the appropriate input box. Clicking the "Submit" button at the bottom will cause the article/entry to be created within local storage and posted to the selected-Category's webpage where it will be immediately visible.
 - Each webpage will be scroll-able with an index panel (also scroll-able) to the side of the webpage where each article's title can be seen and clicked on. Clicking on the title will open the article in the empty area next to the index for the reader, while clicking on the title a second time will close the article. Clicking on a different title will close the article and open the newly-selected article. The options for alphabetical order & chronological order will be added as well.
 - Each article's display will have an "Edit" button at the bottom of the article's page, allowing any article entry to be updated at any time. These edits will be immediately visible on the webpage and local storage after clicking the "Update" button.
